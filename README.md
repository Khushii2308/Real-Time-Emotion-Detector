# Real-Time-Emotion-Detector
## Overview
The Real-Time Emotion Detector is a Python-based application that utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect and classify human emotions in real-time. The model processes facial expressions from live video feeds or images and predicts emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.

## Features
- Real-Time Emotion Detection: Uses a webcam or video feed to analyze facial expressions.
- Machine Learning Model: Trained on a labeled dataset to recognize various emotions.
- OpenCV Integration: Utilizes OpenCV for face detection and preprocessing.
- Deep Learning Support: Implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for emotion classification.
- User-Friendly Interface: Can be integrated into GUI applications for ease of use.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   sh
   git clone https://github.com/Khushii2308/Real-Time-Emotion-Detector.git
   cd Real-Time-Emotion-Detector
   
2. Install required dependencies:
   sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Ensure you have a webcam or a video feed available for real-time detection.

## Usage
### Running the Emotion Detector
To start detecting emotions in real-time:
python emotion_detector.py

### Testing with an Image
To classify the emotion from a static image:
python image_emotion.py --image path/to/image.jpg

## Deployment
The model can be deployed as a web or desktop application using Flask, FastAPI, or Tkinter.
